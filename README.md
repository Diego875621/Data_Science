# Diego Andrade Silva
<sub>*Data Scientist and Pharmacist*</sub>

I am skilled in writing, scientific experiments, and research methodology. My soft skills include good emotional control, empathy, and a high ability to explain complex concepts in simple ways, which were mostly obtained when I tutored and taught, plus I work with the general public, my patients as a pharmacist in a community pharmacy.

I have a bachelor's degree in Pharmacy and am specializing in clinical and prescription pharmacy. My scientific initiation was on analytical chemistry with validation of analytical methods by HPLC on drugs. In addition, I am now learning Data Science and am thinking about integrating my knowledge, applying it to business and academia.
